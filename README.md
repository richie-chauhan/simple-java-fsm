# Finite State Machine (FSM) in Java implemented with enums

This project is to explain the concept of a Finite State Machine and how to implement it in Java. 
Note this also has variables associated with different states. 

Also - note - at this time no attempt has been made to make it presentable - it's simply a dump. 

The source implements the following state diagram
