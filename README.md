# Finite State Machine (FSM) in Java implemented with enums

This project is to explain the concept of a Finite State Machine and how to implement it in Java.  
  
**Note**: This FSM has memory with a variable associated with different states. It is the cars price variable. 
  
Also - note - at this time no attempt has been made to make it presentable - it's simply a dump.   
  
The source implements the following state diagram
